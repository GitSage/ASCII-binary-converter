# ASCII-binary-converter
A multithreaded ASCII/binary converter. Completed as a class project.

This project is part of my Tech 202 final project, which is a creativity project.

The following actions will be possible:

-Convert any ASCII text to a false binary representation. I say "false binary representation" because, rather than,
 converting ASCII to binary numbers, it converts it to ASCII 1's and 0's.
-The reverse of the above (that is, convert false binary to ordinary ASCII).
